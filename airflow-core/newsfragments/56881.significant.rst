.. Write a short and imperative summary of this changes

Custom SerDe methods defined on classes now take precedence over the built-in SerDe methods.

.. Provide additional contextual information
Previously, the SerDe precedence prioritized built-in serializers in airflow-core over those that users defined
in their classes with the ``serialize(self)`` and ``deserialize(data: dict, version: int)`` methods.
This behavior has been changed to always use custom SerDe methods before considering built-in SerDe methods.

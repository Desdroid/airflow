Prioritize custom SerDe methods defined in classes over the built-in SerDe methods.

Previously, the SerDe logic prioritized built-in serializers in airflow-core over those that users defined
in their classes with the ``serialize(self)`` and ``deserialize(data: dict, version: int)`` methods.
This behavior has been changed to always use custom SerDe methods before considering built-in SerDe methods.
